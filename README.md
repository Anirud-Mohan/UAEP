## 🛠️ Solution

This project allows users to input their academic and test scores (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, LOR, SOP, Research Papers, etc.) and receive a **percentage-based prediction** of their admission chances. Here's how it works:

1. **User Input**: Students enter their scores and details into a simple web form.
2. **Prediction Model**: A **Linear Regression Model** evaluates the input data to predict eligibility.
3. **Result Display**: 
   - If eligible, the user is directed to a **success page** with their results.
   - If not eligible, the user is directed to a **failure page** with their results.
4. **Decimal Inputs**: For more accurate predictions, users can input scores in decimal format.
